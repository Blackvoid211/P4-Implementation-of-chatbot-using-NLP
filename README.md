# Simple Chatbot Using NLP

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot handles user input through auditory or textual methods, simulating human-like interactions. It is designed to process and respond to basic queries, providing appropriate responses based on the detected intent. The chatbot uses keyword matching to identify user intentions and respond accordingly. This project aims to demonstrate basic NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and intent detection.

## Features
- **User Input Handling**: Accepts user queries and processes the input.
- **Intent Detection**: Identifies keywords and responds based on detected intent.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes basic NLP techniques like tokenization and stopword removal.
- **Response Generation**: Returns predefined responses based on matched intent.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopwords removal.
  - `scikit-learn`: For future use in intent classification using machine learning.
  - `numpy`: For handling numeric operations in chatbot logic.
  - `streamlit`: For building a simple user interface for chatbot interaction.
